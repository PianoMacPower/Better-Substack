Here is found my Safari extension for Substack! In its present state, the extension can hide "Note" posts and other distracting elements of the website.

## Installation
To install, make sure the Developer Mode of Safari is enabled. In Safari settings, under the Developer tab, click "Add Temporary Extension" and select the file!

## Notice
This is a personal project - it may have bugs, and will not be consistently updated. Enjoy!
